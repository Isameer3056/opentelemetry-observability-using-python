# opentelemetry-observability-using-python

A hands-on project to learn and implement **observability for Python microservices** using the **OpenTelemetry stack**.  
This demo showcases how to collect and visualize **metrics, logs, and traces** across multiple FastAPI services, similar to what an SRE or DevOps engineer would build in a real-world environment.

---

## üöÄ Why This Project?
Modern systems are **distributed** and often complex. Debugging and monitoring them without proper observability tools is nearly impossible.  
This project helps answer questions like:
- Is my service healthy?
- How many requests is it handling?
- Where are failures happening?
- How do I trace a request across multiple services?

By building this stack, I explored how observability connects the dots between **metrics, logs, and traces** to give complete visibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python 3 + FastAPI** ‚Üí Three microservices (`app-a`, `app-b`, `app-c`)  
- **OpenTelemetry SDK** ‚Üí Automatic instrumentation for metrics, logs, and traces  
- **Prometheus** ‚Üí Metrics collection  
- **Loki** ‚Üí Centralized log aggregation  
- **Tempo** ‚Üí Distributed tracing  
- **Grafana** ‚Üí Visualization layer  
- **Docker & Docker-Compose** ‚Üí Container orchestration

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/opentelemetry-observability-using-python.git
cd opentelemetry-observability-using-python
```
### 2. Build and run
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```
This launches all three apps along with Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, and Grafana.
### 3. Verify the apps
```
curl http://localhost:8000
curl http://localhost:8001
curl http://localhost:8002
```
## Generate Load
Send requests so telemetry data starts flowing:

Linux / Mac

```
while true; do curl -s http://localhost:8000 > /dev/null; sleep 1; done
```
Windows (PowerShell)
```
powershell

while ($true) { curl http://localhost:8000 | Out-Null; Start-Sleep -Seconds 1 }
```
Repeat for 8001 and 8002.

### üìä Visualize Observability Data
- Grafana ‚Üí http://localhost:3000 (default login: admin/admin)

- Prometheus ‚Üí http://localhost:9090

- Loki ‚Üí Logs via Grafana Explore

- Tempo ‚Üí Traces via Grafana Explore
---

Example queries in Grafana:

- **Metrics (Prometheus)**:

```scss
rate(http_server_requests_total[1m])
```
- **Logs (Loki)**:

```
{container="app-a"}
```
- **Traces (Tempo)**: Search by service name `app-a`, `app-b`, `app-c`
---

### üìå Insights & Learnings
- Traces help follow a single request across multiple services.

- Logs provide context and are correlated with traces.

- Metrics give quantitative signals about performance and failures.

- Grafana becomes a single pane of glass for all observability data.

- Running everything in Docker-Compose makes it easy to test locally.

This project provided me with a practical understanding of how SREs and DevOps engineers can monitor, troubleshoot, and improve distributed systems.
